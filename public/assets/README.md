# Assets Directory

This directory contains all static assets for the Why Us page.

## Image Placeholders

All images are currently using placeholder URLs from Unsplash. Replace them with your actual images:

- `hero.jpg` - Main hero section image (recommended: 1200x800px)
- `section-1.jpg` - First content section image (recommended: 800x600px)
- `section-2.jpg` - Second content section image (recommended: 800x600px)
- `section-3.jpg` - Third content section image (recommended: 800x600px)

## SVG Assets

- `logo.svg` - Company logo (recommended: 200x50px)
- `feature-1.svg` through `feature-4.svg` - Feature icons (recommended: 64x64px)

## How to Replace Images

1. Add your images to this `public/assets/` directory
2. Use the same filenames as listed above
3. Ensure images are optimized (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
4. Recommended formats: WebP for photos, SVG for logos/icons

## Current Placeholder Sources

The components currently use Unsplash placeholder images that will automatically load if local files are not found. This ensures the page always displays something while you're setting up your assets.
